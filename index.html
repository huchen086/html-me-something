				<h2>Northern Cardinal</h2>
				<p>A common permanent resident. It forages on the ground or in shrubs for 
				insects, spiders, seeds, fruits, and berries. The “redbird” is a frequent 
				visitor to bird feeders for sunflower and other seeds. Females are buffy 
				tan below and grayish brown above, otherwise similar to male. By February, 
				cardinals are in full song, singing from the tops of small trees and shrubs 
				most of the day.</p>

				<h2>American Goldfinch</h2>
				<p>In summer, the canary-yellow bird with black wings. Found year-round in 
				grasslands and suburban areas. They stick together in flocks and have a 
				noticeable undulating — or dipping — flight pattern. Their yellow color fades 
				to olive in winter.</p>

				<h2>Blue Jay</h2>
				<p>Though this common permanent resident may be present all year in your yard, 
				they are probably different individuals during each season. They frequently 
				chase smaller birds away from bird feeders, gather up several seeds, and then 
				fly off to cache them in a tree or in the ground. Blue jays are frequently 
				noisy and easily detected in tree canopies. They often form groups and chase 
				and mob hawks and owls they encounter.</p>

				<h2>Black-capped Chickadee</h2>
				<p>The common feeder birds that call chickadee-dee-dee. Common year-round in 
				forests, woodlands, and neighborhoods with plenty of large trees. The 
				black-capped is found in northern Missouri and the Carolina in southern Missouri. 
				Similar in appearance, the black-capped has more white on its wing in winter and 
				its call is slower. Both are frequent visitors to feeders and easily approached.</p>

				<h2>Tufted Titmouse</h2>
				<p>The scolding bird with a pointed crest atop its head. Lives year-round in 
				forests, woodlands, and suburban areas. Makes a distinct peter-peter-peter 
				whistling sound.</p>

				<h2>Mourning Dove</h2>
				<p>The cooing lovebird. Found in grasslands, towns, and suburbs. Common year-round, 
				though especially abundant in spring and summer, less so in fall, and rare in 
				winter. Shaped somewhat like rock pigeons, though slimmer.</p>
